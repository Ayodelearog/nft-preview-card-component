## Overview
This was a fun mini project for me for because I got to practice my CSS, and it's beautiful UI :)
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
I had a few bugs while working on this, so I learned how to fix the "Sass build module failed" bug. I also learned how to use the "require" function to import image because for some reasons, I was unable to use the normal <img/> tag to import my images, so I had to use "require("imageFilePath")" after importing the image at the top of my file.
I also worked on image overlay, which was a bit of a challenge because I haven't usd it before. But I think the results are satisfying.


```js
import "../images/image-avatar.png";

const avatar = require("../images/image-avatar.png");
```


### Continued development
I hope to work on bigger, more complex projects, so I can get better.
